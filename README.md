# ARTIC-2-UShER
Converts standard multiple sequence alignment output from the SARS-CoV-2 ARTIC Network protocol (see https://artic.network/ncov-2019) into a merged VCF viable for input to UShER (Ultrafast Sample Placement on Existing Trees). ARTIC-2-UShER also considers missing data in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and filters variants at problematic sites (see https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473/12 and https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2020/06/09/2020.06.08.141127.full.pdf).
